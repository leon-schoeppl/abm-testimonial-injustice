### ABM testimonial injustice

Testimonial injustice, together with hermeneutic injustice, are the two main forms of epistemic injustice identified by Miranda Fricker. Kristie Dotson further differentiates two ways in which testimonial injustice is brought about, two different ways of silencing the testimony of individuals: During testimonial quieting the testimony is given less uptake than appropriate, e.g. the speaker is not taken seriously, dismissed. During testimonial smothering, the speaker is coerced/ pressured by the situation to tailor their own testimony to the biases and identities of those listening.

It is natural to assume that these two forms of silencing would interplay directly, in that testimonial smothering is a reaction/ adaptation of speakers who experience(d) testimonial quieting. This project aims to create an agent based NetLogo model to simulate these two concepts and their relation/ interactions. The results will be handed in as a term paper in the course *Formal Methods 2 (summer 2021)* taught by Rush Steward at the *Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy*.
